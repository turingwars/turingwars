# Turing wars web stack

## Quick start

```sh
# Install all dependencies, builds and runs in watch mode for development
make serve
```

In theory, you should never have to restart the server once it is started. All files are watched and everything is reloaded when needed (frontend and backend).

### I want to TDD stuff

```sh
# Run tests once
npm test
# Watch files and run tests automatically
npm run test:watch
```
