This is a work in progress. The goal of these files is to provide a way to create typed REST APIs
that speed up development across the client/server boundary. Right now it's working pretty well. You
add an endpoint to `api.ts` and then TypeScript expects you to define a route handler for this endpoint
on the server. You can then call this api from the client and you let intellisense tell you what attributes
are available on the response.

The combination of CTRL+click and SHIFT+F12 (find all references) helps you teleport from API usage to
route handler and back.

There are a few things that I'm not happy about yet and I'll get back to them. Hopefully I can polish
this well enough to extract it to its own node module at some point.
